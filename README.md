THE FOLLOWING REPOSITORY CONTAIN SCRATCH IMPLEMENTATION OF POPULOR MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS
#
WARNING - 
the algorithm may lag in comparision to the implementation of populor libraries (such as sklearn, pytorch, tensorflow) in terms of
speed, automatic regularization, automatic iteration and may have some bugs in them, 
otherwise i tried my best to make it bug free and reliable to use.
